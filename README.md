# Fib_numb_cool
** Did you know you can make any natural number by adding some combination of fibonacci numbers?! 
Here is a commmand-line program to find the lowest number of unique fibonacci numebers that sum to any given natural number.
# Features
 - Large numbers are encouraged (try 2997000102309100000)
 - Runs very fast
 - Small and light-weight
 - Fun to play with (maybe)
# How do you use this?
 This program takes no arguments nor user input for selecting an natural number. Instead, you must downlaod and modify the source file. Specifically, hard code the "target" variable to the natural number of your choice. Then, compile the code (using gcc) and run the program. 
# Why did I make this?
 Well, glad you asked. I came down to the computer lab at midnight to escape some pungent perfume smell that seeped into my dorm room from the hallway. I go to the University of Michigan (Go blue!). Anyway, instead of doing my school work, I wanted to make the computer perform some computationally expensive and time expensive task. I just find it cool when there's like some sort of a progress bar as the computer does its thing to accomplish whatever task it needs to do. Perhaps the best way to do this would be through some data science and model training. But I don't know that yet so, i tried to wrtie some other program and came up with this. 
 
Unfortunately, it took me like 2+ hours to develep and literally ran in less than a second no matter how big of a number I gave. So basically, I came up with this program but it didn't even achieve what I want it to do. But hey, at least it's fast.
# Why would you use this?
  - You are bored
  - you want to see if you can catch an bug or find an error in my program
  - you want to adapt, modify, or extend the functionality of this program to produce something even better
  - you wish to read and review simple,digestible C++ code with an interesting application.
